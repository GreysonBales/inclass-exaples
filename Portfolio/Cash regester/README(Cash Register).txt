The cash register program will just tell you how much money you spent or will be spending on 
certain items. that is if all your items are the same cost and you know what your tax amount it.


when you run it, it will ask what your cost of item is, total number of said item
and then finally what you tax amount is.

it will then show you how much each item is, sub total, taxes paid, and total.
